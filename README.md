# Hi, I’m Fuat 👋  

I’m fascinated by how machines can **think in images**.  
My research focuses on **diffusion and generative models**, and how they can be applied to **MRI reconstruction and medical imaging** — bridging theory with impact in healthcare.  

📍 Currently pursuing my **M.S. in Electrical & Electronics Engineering at Bilkent University** (Advisor: Prof. Tolga Çukur).
